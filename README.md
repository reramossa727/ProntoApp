Please create an iOS app that displays a Google Map with the current location of the user, and also displays a list of nearby restaurants on the map.
Main Tasks :
- Google map to be displayed with current user location.
- Display a list of nearby restaurants on the map based on the current location of the user (you can use the Places Api for this). Tapping on the marker/pin will show the name & icon for the place.
- The user should also be able to search for a  address using a Textfield positioned along with the map.
- User should be able to select a place from the search results, which would in turn display a pin/marker at the selected place on the map, and zoom the map out to display both the place pin, and current location of the user.
- For the search places textfield, cache the last 10 searched results and display the cached list while the user is searching for places. The use should be able to see the "Recent" list and select a previously searched address instead of searching for it again.
Additional Task (Optional) :
- Display the list of nearby restaurants (that are displayed on the map as pins/markers) in a UITableview. It’s up to you on how/where to add the Tableview list for display.
Plus Points :
- Unit tests
- RxSwift
- MVVM or some other pattern to separate concerns with business logic and UI.
